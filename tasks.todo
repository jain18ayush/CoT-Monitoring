- Create graphs for simple ablation step
- Collect data for causal chain relation step 
- Collect some examples of the data in action 

- What else can I analyze per step? 
-- One more metric then make the report 
    -- check to see which steps are necessary for the final outcome by zeroing out all other steps , or finding the minimum step limit to guess the final outcome? <-- after this we are finito
